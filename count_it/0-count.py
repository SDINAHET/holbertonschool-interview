"""
Recursive Reddit hot titles keyword counter.

- Uses Reddit public API without following redirects.
- Counts occurrences of exact space-delimited tokens (case-insensitive).
- Handles duplicates in word_list by summing their weights.
- Prints results sorted by descending count, then alphabetically.
- Prints nothing for invalid subreddit or when all counts are zero.
